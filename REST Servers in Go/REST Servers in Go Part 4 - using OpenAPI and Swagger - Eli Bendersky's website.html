</ul>
<p>In this part I'll discuss how OpenAPI and Swagger can be used to define REST
APIs in a standardized way and how to generate Go code from an OpenAPI
specification.</p>
<div class="section" id="motivating-problem">
<h2>Motivating problem</h2>
<p>In Part 1 of this series - when we were defining the REST API for our
application - I noted that the API definition is somewhat ad-hoc, just a list of
method/path pairs along with some comments:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>POST   /task/              :  create a task, returns ID
GET    /task/&lt;taskid&gt;      :  returns a single task by ID
GET    /task/              :  returns all tasks
DELETE /task/&lt;taskid&gt;      :  delete a task by ID
GET    /tag/&lt;tagname&gt;      :  returns list of tasks with this tag
GET    /due/&lt;yy&gt;/&lt;mm&gt;/&lt;dd&gt; :  returns list of tasks due by this date
</pre></div>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice it there was some standard way to describe the API? A
standard means the description could serve as a contract between servers and
clients. Moreover, a standard description would be immediately familiar to folks
not intimately involved with the project. It could also be machine-readable,
leading to all kinds of automation benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="swagger-and-openapi">
<h2>Swagger and OpenAPI</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swagger_(software)">Swagger</a> was initially
released in 2011 as an <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language">IDL</a> for describing
REST APIs.</p>
<img alt="Swagger logo" class="align-center" src="REST%20Servers%20in%20Go%20Part%204%20-%20using%20OpenAPI%20and%20Swagger%20-%20Eli%20Bendersky's%20website_files/swagger-logo.png">
<p>The original motivation for Swagger was auto-generating documentation for REST
APIs, as well as trying out sample interactions with the API <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The year 2014 saw the release of version 2.0, and in 2016 a bunch of
large companies in the industry teamed up to create OpenAPI - a more
standardized version of Swagger, with version 3.0.</p>
<p>The official website for all things Swagger and OpenAPI is <a class="reference external" href="https://swagger.io/">https://swagger.io</a>,
supported by <a class="reference external" href="https://smartbear.com/">Smart Bear Software</a>.</p>
<p>The nomenclature around this is slightly confusing, but the simplest way to
remember is that OpenAPI is the current name of the specification, while Swagger
typically refers to the tooling around it (though you may also hear "Swagger
specification", especially when referring to versions earlier than 3.0).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="our-task-service-with-an-openapi-definition">
<h2>Our task service with an OpenAPI definition</h2>
<p>Let's start by repeating our favorite exercise of rewriting the task service,
this time using OpenAPI and Swagger.</p>
<p>To do this, I spent some time reading the OpenAPI 3.0 documentation and fired up
<a class="reference external" href="https://editor.swagger.io/">Swagger Editor</a> to type in the specification as
a YAML file. It took a while, and the final result is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/blob/master/2021/go-rest-servers/swagger/task.yaml">this file</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the following code snippet is the description of the <tt class="docutils literal">GET /task/</tt>
request, which is supposed to return all tasks. In an OpenAPI spec we can
specify an arbitrary number of <em>paths</em>, each with its different <em>methods</em> (GET,
POST, etc.) and a description of its parameters and responses, along with JSON
schemas.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/task:
  get:
    summary: Returns a list of all tasks
    responses:
      '200':
        description: A JSON array of task IDs
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: array
              items:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Task'
</pre></div>
<p>Where <tt class="docutils literal">components/schemas/Task</tt> is a reference to this definition of our
<tt class="docutils literal">Task</tt> model:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>components:
  schemas:
    Task:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        text:
          type: string
        tags:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
        due:
          type: string
          format: date-time
</pre></div>
<p>This is a description of a data <em>schema</em>; note that we can specify types for
data fields, which (in theory, at least) could be helpful in auto-generating
validators for this data.</p>
<p>This effort has already produced a benefit - a nice, colorful documentation for
our API:</p>
<img alt="Swagger-generated documentation image for our REST API" class="align-center" src="REST%20Servers%20in%20Go%20Part%204%20-%20using%20OpenAPI%20and%20Swagger%20-%20Eli%20Bendersky's%20website_files/go-rest-swagger-doc.png">
<p>This is just a screenshot; the actual documentation is clickable and expandable,
providing a clear description of request parameters, responses and their JSON
schemas, etc.</p>
<p>There's more, though. Assuming this API is hosted in a publicly-accessible
server, we can interact with it straight from the Swagger Editor - just like
hand-crafting <tt class="docutils literal">curl</tt> commands, but in an auto-generated schema-aware way.</p>
<p>Imagine you've developed this task API and now want to publish it for use in
various clients (web, mobile, etc.); if your API is specified with
OpenAPI/Swagger, you get automatic documentation and an interface for clients to
experiment with the API. This is doubly important when you have API consumers
who aren't SW engineers - for example, this could be UX designers, technical
documentation writers and product managers who need to understand an API but may
be less comfortable throwing scripts together.</p>
<p>Moreover, OpenAPI standardizes things like authorization, which could also be
very useful when compared with an ad-hoc description.</p>
<p>There are additional tools available once you have a spec - e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/">Swagger UI</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-inspector/">Swagger Inspector</a>. You can even use the spec to
help integrate your REST server into your cloud provider's infrastructure; for
example, GCP has <a class="reference external" href="https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi">Cloud Endpoints for OpenAPI</a> for setting up monitoring,
analysis and other features for published APIs; the API is described to the tool
using OpenAPI.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="auto-generating-a-go-server-scaffold">
<h2>Auto-generating a Go server scaffold</h2>
<p>The promise of OpenAPI/Swagger goes beyond documentation; we can also generate
server and client code from it.</p>
<p>I followed the official instructions of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">Swagger codegen project</a> to generate the skeleton of
a Go server. I then filled in the handlers to implement our task server. It's
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/master/2021/go-rest-servers/swagger">available here</a>,
with the steps I used written down in the README file in that directory. This
server now passes all our automated tests.</p>
<p>The generated code uses <tt class="docutils literal">gorilla/mux</tt> for routing (similarly to our approach
in <a class="reference external" href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2021/rest-servers-in-go-part-2-using-a-router-package/">part 2</a>)
and creates placeholder handlers in a file named <tt class="docutils literal">api_default.go</tt>. I've placed
the by-now familiar task logic into these handlers; for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">func</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">TaskIdDelete</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">w</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ResponseWriter</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">r</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Request</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>While working on this, I've collected a few notes on the limitations of this
approach:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The generated code's package naming / imports didn't work well out of the
box, at least not with Go modules. I had to restructure it quite a bit.</li>
<li>Some of the generated files didn't comply with <tt class="docutils literal">gofmt</tt> formatting for some
reason.</li>
<li>The code forces globals in the server; whereas in the previous parts we've
always had a server struct whose methods were registered as handlers (and
therefore the struct instance's fields served as shared data), in the
server generated by Swagger the handlers are top-level functions.</li>
<li>Even though my OpenAPI definition has a schema forcing integer values on
certain path parameters (such as day, month year in the <tt class="docutils literal">due/</tt> path),
the generated server had no validation for that. Moreover, although
<tt class="docutils literal">gorilla/mux</tt> supports regexps in path parameters, the generated code didn't
even use that. The result: I had to write parameter validation manually again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the advantages of auto-generating the server code seem dubious to me.
The amount of time it saves is fairly small, considering that I had to rewrite a
bunch of the code anyway. Furthermore, since I don't use the generated scaffold
as-is, all the saved time only applies <em>the first time</em>. If I now change the
OpenAPI definition, I can't just ask the code generator to update my server -
they've already diverged.</p>
<p>The <cite>swagger-codegen</cite> tool can also generate <em>clients</em>, including for Go. This
can be useful in some cases, though I found the client code generated by it
somewhat convoluted. As before, it could probably serve as a good starting point
for writing your own client, but unlikely to be part of a continuous workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trying-alternative-code-generators">
<h2>Trying alternative code generators</h2>
<p>OpenAPI specs are written in YAML (or JSON) and have a well-documented format.
Therefore, it's hardly surprising that there's more than a single tool available
to generate server code from a spec. In the previous section I've covered using
the "official" Swagger code generator, but there are many more!</p>
<p>For Go, a popular generator is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger">go-swagger</a>. Its README has this section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How is this different from go generator in swagger-codegen?</strong></p>
<p>tl;dr The main difference at this moment is that this one actually works...</p>
<p>The swagger-codegen project only generates a workable go client and even
there it will only support flat models. Further, the go server generated by
swagger-codegen is mostly a stub.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried generating a server with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">go-swagger</span></tt>. Since the code it generates is
quite large, I won't link to it; but I'll share my impressions.</p>
<p>First of all, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">go-swagger</span></tt> only supports Swagger spec 2.0, not the newest
version 3.0 of OpenAPI. This is rather unfortunate, but I found an
<a class="reference external" href="https://lucybot-inc.github.io/api-spec-converter/">online tool</a>
that converts from one to the other, and a version 2.0 of the spec can also be
found in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/master/2021/go-rest-servers/swagger">the repository</a>.</p>
<p>The server generated by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">go-swagger</span></tt> is certainly more feature-ful than the
one generated by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">swagger-codegen</span></tt>, but it comes at a cost. This essentially
ties you into the specific framework designed by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">go-swagger</span></tt> maintainers.
The generated code has many dependencies on packages in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/go-openapi/">https://github.com/go-openapi/</a> organization, and uses code from these packages
extensively to set up and run the server. You even get custom flag parsing
packages - because... why not?</p>
<p>If you love the framework used therein, that could be a good thing. But if you
have your own ideas in mind - like using Gin or some custom router, it's not
very helpful that the generated code is so opinionated.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">go-swagger</span></tt> can also generate a client for you, which is similarly full
featured and opinionated. This may be less of a problem if you need to quickly
generate some client code for testing, though.</p>
<p><em>Update 2021-02-27</em>: Following a reader suggestion, I tried yet another code
generation tool - <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen">oapi-codegen</a>, and
the task server generated using this tool can be <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/master/2021/go-rest-servers/swagger/oapi-server">found here</a>.</p>
<p>I have to admit I like what <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">oapi-codegen</span></tt> is doing much more than the other
options tried earlier. The code it generates is simple, clean and easy to
split intto the generated part vs. custom code. It even accepts OpenAPI v3! The
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/issues/303">only complaint I have</a> is
that it pulls a dependency on a 3rd-party package just to implement binding of
request parameters, and this is something I'd prefer to be more configurable;
e.g. a setting where I could choose to inline just the right binding code
instead of bringing in a dependency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="generating-specs-from-code">
<h2>Generating specs from code</h2>
<p>What if you already have your REST server implemented, but really like the idea
of an OpenAPI spec for it; in this case, is it possible to generate a spec from
your server code?</p>
<p>Yes! Using special comment annotations and tools like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swaggo/swag">swaggo/swag</a>, the spec (unfortunately only version 2.0,
again) will be generated for you. You can then feed this spec into other Swagger
tooling for all your documentation needs.</p>
<p>In fact, this seems like a particularly attractive option if you have your own
way of writing REST servers and don't want to commit to a new framework just
for the purpose of using Swagger.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion?</h2>
<p>Imagine that you have an application that has to consume a REST API, and there
are two services competing for your attention:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Service 1 has an ad-hoc description of its API in a text file, with some
sample <tt class="docutils literal">curl</tt> commands to interact with it.</li>
<li>Service 2 has an OpenAPI spec, with nice and standard-looking documentation
and tooling to try it out online without having to open the terminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming all other parameters are equal, which API would you choose to try out
first? IMHO the benefits of OpenAPI for documentation and as a standardized
contracts between REST servers and clients is obvious. What's less obvious is
the extent to which we should be taking our use of Swagger tooling.</p>
<p>I'd gladly describe my API with OpenAPI and use the documentation tooling, but
I'd also be more cautious when it comes to generating code. Personally I'd
prefer more control over my server code - what dependencies it has and how it's
structured. While I see value in generating server code for quick prototyping
and experimentation, I wouldn't use an auto-generated server as the basis of
my actual implementation <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, tools like <tt class="docutils literal">swaggo/swag</tt> may offer the perfect balance here. You
write your server code using whatever framework/technique you like, and add
magic comments to describe your REST API. The tool then generates the OpenAPI
spec from these comments, and you can generate documentation or anything else
from that spec. There's the added benefit of keeping the spec source of truth
(the magic comments) as close as possible to the source code implementing it -
always a good practice in SW engineering.</p>
