</ul>
<p>In the previous parts of this series, we've focused on different
approaches to develop a REST API for our simple task management application. In
this part, we're going to take a much larger leap and look at how a similar API
can be exposed with GraphQL instead of REST.</p>
<p>Although this post spends some time explaining the motivation for using GraphQL
and compares GraphQL to REST, this is not its primary goal. There are <em>many</em>
resources explaining these things, and I encourage you to google and read a few.
The main goal of this post is to show an example of setting up a GraphQL server
<em>in Go</em>. To make things simpler, it uses a very similar data model to the one in
previous parts in the series (a simple backend API for managing a task list).</p>
<div class="section" id="motivation-for-graphql">
<h2>Motivation for GraphQL</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL">According to Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a
runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.</blockquote>
<p>Consider our task database as described in <a class="reference external" href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2021/rest-servers-in-go-part-1-standard-library/">part 1</a>;
it's very simplistic, so to really motivate GraphQL we'll want to make it a bit
more realistic. Let's add a sequences of <em>attachments</em> to each task; the Go
model will now look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">type</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Attachment</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">Name</span><span class="w">     </span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="w">    </span><span class="s">`json:"Name"`</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">Contents</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="w">    </span><span class="s">`json:"Contents"`</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="kd">type</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Task</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">ID</span><span class="w">          </span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="w">           </span><span class="s">`json:"Id"`</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">Text</span><span class="w">        </span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="w">        </span><span class="s">`json:"Text"`</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">Tags</span><span class="w">        </span><span class="p">[]</span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="w">      </span><span class="s">`json:"Tags"`</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">Attachments</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[]</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">Attachment</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">`json:"Attachments"`</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Or, if you prefer a database schema diagram:</p>
<img alt="Schema for our tasks data store with a one-to-many from Task to Attachment" class="align-center" src="REST%20Servers%20in%20Go%20Part%207%20-%20GraphQL%20-%20Eli%20Bendersky's%20website_files/tasks-db-schema.png">
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">1 <span class="pre">----</span> *</tt> edge between the boxes implies a <em>one-to-many
relationship</em> in relational database terms. Each task can have multiple
attachments.</p>
<p>So far, our REST API has been:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>POST   /task/              :  create a task, returns ID
GET    /task/&lt;taskid&gt;      :  returns a single task by ID
GET    /task/              :  returns all tasks
DELETE /task/&lt;taskid&gt;      :  delete a task by ID
GET    /tag/&lt;tagname&gt;      :  returns list of tasks with this tag
GET    /due/&lt;yy&gt;/&lt;mm&gt;/&lt;dd&gt; :  returns list of tasks due by this date
</pre></div>
<p>Specifically, note that many of these return <em>a list of tasks</em>. Suppose tasks
have attachments now, as described above. Attachments can be fairly large.
Now getting all the tasks for a tag with <tt class="docutils literal">GET <span class="pre">/tag/&lt;tagname&gt;</span></tt> may return <em>a
lot</em> of data, even if the client only needs the names of the tasks. This isn't
ideal, especially when the internet connection is slow or costs $$$ for
bandwidth (think mobile clients, showing you the task list in a phone app). This
is the problem of <em>over-fetching</em> simple REST APIs suffer from.</p>
<p>To solve the over-fetching problem, a common approach would be to return just
the list of task IDs with <tt class="docutils literal">GET <span class="pre">/tag/&lt;tagname&gt;</span></tt>, instead of the tasks themselves.
Then, having this list of IDs, the client can iterate over it and issue
<tt class="docutils literal">GET <span class="pre">/task/&lt;taskid&gt;</span></tt> request for each. There could still be some over-fetching
here, though, because we may not want the whole task, with attachments; so we
may choose to only return attachment names (or IDs) and have yet another API
endpoint to fetch <em>these</em>.</p>
<p>Now we have an opposite problem: <em>under-fetching</em>. Instead of issuing a single
network request to get the information we need, we issue a whole bunch -
potentially one for every task with a tag and then one for each attachment of
this task. This approach has its own issues, e.g. higher latency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-graphql-addresses-over-fetching-and-under-fetching">
<h2>How GraphQL addresses over-fetching and under-fetching</h2>
<p>Let's spend a minute thinking how we could solve this issue. Obviously, we could
design a specific REST endpoint to just give us the data we need. For example,
<tt class="docutils literal">GET <span class="pre">/task-name-and-attachment-name-in-tag/&lt;tagname&gt;</span></tt> could return a list of
task names, with a list of attachment names for each. No over-fetching, no
under-fetching! This would work, and some REST APIs have specialized endpoints
like this one; but the problem is obvious - this is hard to scale! Now suppose
I want the same information, but not by tag; I want it by due date. Will I have
to write a very similar endpoint, just for due date? It's possible,
of course, but it should be obvious that as the API gets more complicated, there
will be a lot of duplication.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to have a single endpoint to which I can submit a more
complicated request. Let's call it a <em>query</em>. The query would express exactly
what parts of the data I want; a bit like SQL.</p>
<p>Well, this is what GraphQL does. I'll get back to the SQL comparison later on,
but for now let's see how GraphQL solves this. This is a GraphQL query that can
be sent by the client:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>query {
  getTasksByTag(tag: "shopping") {
    Text
    Attachments{
      Name
    }
  }
}
</pre></div>
<p>It will return a list of tasks, but for each task only the text of the task and
the name of all its attachments will be returned. This is exactly the data we
want, in a single response.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-task-server-in-go-with-graphql">
<h2>A task server in Go with GraphQL</h2>
<p>I've taken the task server from the previous parts in the series, and rewrote it
to use GraphQL. The data model was updated to include attachments, as described
above. The full code for the server is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/master/2021/taskstore-graphql">available here</a>.</p>
<p>There are several packages for GraphQL in Go; for this experiment, I went with
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen">gqlgen</a>. It takes a GraphQL schema as
input and generates a bunch of Go code to implement an HTTP server for serving
queries in these schemas; the actual handlers (called <em>resolvers</em> in GraphQL
parlance) are left as stubs for the developer to implement. gqlgen has a
<a class="reference external" href="https://gqlgen.com/getting-started/">decent tutorial</a>, so here I'll just
focus on explaining how my server works.</p>
<p>Here's the GraphQL schema for our tasks backend <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>type Query {
    getAllTasks: [Task]
    getTask(id: ID!): Task

    getTasksByTag(tag: String!): [Task]
    getTasksByDue(due: Time!): [Task]
}

type Mutation {
    createTask(input: NewTask!): Task!

    deleteTask(id: ID!): Boolean
    deleteAllTasks: Boolean
}

scalar Time

type Attachment {
    Name: String!
    Date: Time!
    Contents: String!
}

type Task {
    Id: ID!
    Text: String!
    Tags: [String!]
    Due: Time!
    Attachments: [Attachment!]
}

input NewAttachment {
    Name: String!
    Date: Time!
    Contents: String!
}

input NewTask {
    Text: String!
    Tags: [String!]
    Due: Time!
    Attachments: [NewAttachment!]
}
</pre></div>
<p>Several things to note here:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal">Query</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Mutation</tt> types are special in GraphQL - they define
the actual API. The other types are interesting too - GraphQL is
strongly typed! This is nice, as it makes validation of input a better defined
task (the JSON typically used in REST is much less strongly typed).</li>
<li>Even though APIs in the <tt class="docutils literal">Query</tt> type appear to return <tt class="docutils literal">[Task]</tt>, which is
a list of tasks, there is no over-fetching here. As the sample query in the
previous section demonstrates, GraphQL lets clients specify exactly the fields
they want from the returned values in their query, and only these fields get
tranferred over the wire. See my sample query earlier for a realistic example.</li>
<li>GraphQL doesn't have a build-in type for times and dates, but one can write
extensions; here I'm using the <tt class="docutils literal">scalar Time</tt> extension which is built into
gqlgen - it maps it to Go's <tt class="docutils literal">time.Time</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, it's hard to not notice the <tt class="docutils literal">NewTask</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">NewAttachment</tt> types
that duplicate <tt class="docutils literal">Task</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Attachment</tt>. What's up with that? The answer here
is rather complicated. GraphQL types can represent graphs, in the sense that
one task can have multiple attachments, but in theory each attachment can belong
to multiple tasks. This could be the source of the "graph" in GraphQL's name
(I'll be happy to know if I'm wrong about this!), and it's very different from
how we design relational databases.</p>
<p>Such graph data could be tricky to construct in a parameter; if it's mutually
recursive, how do you do it? So GraphQL opted for a strict separation - types
usable as inputs need to be clearly marked as such, and can only be <em>trees</em>,
not <em>graphs</em>. Therefore, while we theoretically could have reused <tt class="docutils literal">Task</tt> for
input parameters (since it's not a graph), GraphQL forbids this and insists on
a new type.</p>
<p>The steps I followed with my project were:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen init</tt></li>
<li>Write my GraphQL schema as shown above</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate</tt></li>
<li>Update the generated code to implement my resolvers</li>
<li>Run the generated <tt class="docutils literal">server.go</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>For the resolvers, gqlgen emits an empty struct type called <tt class="docutils literal">Resolver</tt>, on
which the handler methods are defined. This struct should be updated by the
application to include any shared context information needed for all resolvers.
For the task application, we just need the task store:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">type</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Resolver</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">Store</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">taskstore</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">TaskStore</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>gqlgen also generates stub handler methods which we should fill in. For most
resolvers, this is trivial; for example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">func</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">r</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">queryResolver</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">GetAllTasks</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ctx</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">context</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Context</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">([]</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">model</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Task</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">error</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">r</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Store</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">GetAllTasks</span><span class="p">(),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">nil</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that our resolver returns the list of tasks in their entirety; the field
selection (or "no over-fetching") feature of GraphQL is implemented by the
code gqlgen generates for us. As far as I could find, there's not way to know in
the resolver which fieds the query is asking for, so we always have to fetch
everything from the DB <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>. This may be a limitation of gqlgen, or it just may
be the way all GraphQL servers work - I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Finally, gqlgen generates a <tt class="docutils literal">main</tt> function for us in <tt class="docutils literal">server.go</tt>, which we
can tweak:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">func</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">main</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<p>Here <tt class="docutils literal">handler.NewDefaultServer</tt> is the GraphQL server, and it's registered on
the <tt class="docutils literal">/query</tt> path. We could add more paths here - for example, we could even
mix REST with GraphQL.</p>

<h2>Playground - interacting with a GraphQL server</h2>
<p>One of the coolest features of GraphQL is the <em>playground</em> which makes it very
pleasant and easy to experiment with a server right from the browser. In the
server code above, you'll note the <tt class="docutils literal">playground.Handler</tt> registered to serve
on the root path. It serves a single-page application called
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground">graphql-playground</a>; here's
how it looks:</p>
<img alt="Screenshot of the GraphQL playground interacting with our server" class="align-center" src="REST%20Servers%20in%20Go%20Part%207%20-%20GraphQL%20-%20Eli%20Bendersky's%20website_files/graphql-playground-screenshot.png">
<p>As you can see, I typed in the query mentioned earlier and when it runs,
the data returned by the server can be seen in the right pane. The playground
includes syntax highlighting, completion, multiple tabs and even allows you
to translate queries into <tt class="docutils literal">curl</tt> invocations if you need to save them to
testing scripts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="graphql-vs-rest">
<h2>GraphQL vs. REST</h2>
<p>At the basic level, GraphQL has some clear advantages vs. REST, particularly in
the area of efficiency where over- or under-fetching can cause REST APIs to be
suboptimal. That said, this flexibility in GraphQL comes at a cost - it becomes
very easy to submit arbitrarily complex GraphQL queries and thus cause DoS
attacks to the server; obviously, best practices are evolving to help GraphQL
server developers avoid these pitfalls.</p>
<p>GraphQL is an emerging technology, and a lot of interesting tooling is evolving
along with it - like the playground shown above. However, REST has been around
for much longer and is difficult to compete with w.r.t. tooling and
interoperability. Pretty much any server has a REST API today, and much tooling
has been built for monitoring, logging, profiling and other introspection of
REST APIs. REST is also very <em>simple</em> - just paths to access over HTTP, and can
often be exercised with simple <tt class="docutils literal">curl</tt> invocations or in the browser. GraphQL
is more involved as the query has to be placed into the body of a POST request.</p>
<p>The simplicity of REST has a deeper implication; in a typical web backend,
REST queries will be serviced by (often non-trivial) SQL queries sent to a DB.
GraphQL adds its own query language, which is a little bit like SQL in some ways
but also very different in other ways, because the graph model it relies on is
not really relational. So GraphQL, in my experience, makes you keep more state
in your head - the state of the GraphQL query <em>and</em> how it maps to the
underlying relational DB. Emerging projects like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph">Dgraph</a> (a native GraphQL DB with a graph
backend) and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/">PostGraphile</a> (an
automatic mapper bewteen GraphQL and PostgreSQL) are interesting players worth
watching in this field.</p>
<p>Another point worth mentioning is caching; REST plays well with HTTP caching,
since much of it relies on idempotent GET requests. GraphQL is trickier in this
regard, since it doesn't distinguish between idempotent data queries and
mutations on the HTTP level.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, engineers are either constrained by the systems they have
to interact with, or (in rare, lucky cases) have the ability to choose the
technology for a new project. In the latter case, pick the right tool for the
job. It's good to have more options!</p>
